I almost went back inside when something on this huge palm tree leaf caught my eye. I stayed around and it was this little gecko, startled by my presence he was hidden between the ridges of the leaf. He would pop his head up periodically to check his surroundings, as soon as he saw i was still there he would hide again. We played this game for a while until i got the shot.

                  Mourinho: Pogba deserves more respect
                  </h4>

                  Jose Mourinho believes Paul Pogba deserves more respect from football pundits as he continues to be an influential performer for Manchester United in his first season back at the club.

                  The Frenchman's record price tag means his performances can be subject to media scrutiny but at Wednesday's pre-match press conference, Mourinho reiterated that everybody at the club is happy with the midfielder's contribution. The manager feels the player, who turns 24 today, is having to deal with undue criticism and suggests that envy may be a factor in the flak.

                  "I feel that the world is losing values and we all know that and envy is coming into certain levels," said Mourinho, on the eve of United's second leg against FC Rostov.

                  "I'm scared for especially the next generation if things go in this direction. Envy is everywhere.

                  "It's not Paul's fault that he gets 10 times the money that some players, some very good players, got in the past. It's not his fault that some of the pundits are in real trouble with their lives and they need every pound to survive and Paul is a multi-millionaire. It's not his fault.

                  "I think he deserves respect. I think his family deserve respect. He's a kid that comes from a working family, a family with three boys and I'm sure they needed a lot of food on that table every day because they are big giants. So I'm sure that the mum and the dad had to work hard for many, many years for them.

                  "He is a kid that came to Manchester as a teenager, that fought for his career here, that was not afraid to move and to go to another country and to look for better conditions for him. A kid that reached the top of the world with his work, nobody gave him anything.

                  "I'm very happy with Paul. The club is very happy with Paul and I think also a good thing is that because of his personality, he doesn't given an ass what people say."

              The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement. José Mourinho is the club's current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016.

              Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2015–16, with an annual revenue of €689 million, and the world's third most valuable football club in 2015, valued at £1.98 billion.[8] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The club holds several rivalries, most notably with Liverpool, Manchester City and Leeds United, and more recently with Arsenal.
